/** \brief Debounced Digital Input
 *
 * This class represents an analog switch connected to a digital Input.
 * The active level of the switch is configurable, as it is the pin the
 * switch is connected to.
 * The debouncing technique is to sample the input looking for the active level
 * and, once it is found, start a timer. When the latter times out, we decide if
 * the signal is stable on that level.
 *
